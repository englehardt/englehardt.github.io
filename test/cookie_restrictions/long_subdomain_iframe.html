    <p>This page includes an iframe from trackertest.org that tries to get and set cookies.
    If it is allowed storage access the get and set should work and you should
    see the value twice. If not, you'll only see the value generated for the
    set.</p>
    <p>The real trackertest.org does not host an iframe at such a long subdomain.
    This test page expects you to have set `network.dns.localDomains = a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.trackertest.org`
    and to be serving the iframe locally (https://github.com/mozilla/trackertest/blob/master/set_cookie.html)</p>
